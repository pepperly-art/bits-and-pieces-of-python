## things I've learndeded

### AgeTest.py
    - [import datetime](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp)
    - [while x is None](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1blfl9e/comment/kw61i97/), None being a way to represent the absence of a value. For some reason(?????) I still have to define it as None or it throws an error.
